            At <span className="highlight">Mahisha India Tech</span>, we understand that visual identity is a critical aspect of building a strong and cohesive brand. 
            It’s more than just your logo or color scheme—it’s the visual expression of your brand’s personality, values, and promise. 
            Our approach to visual identity goes beyond aesthetics, creating a visual language that communicates who you are to your audience.

          <h2>What is Visual Identity?</h2>
          <p>
            Visual identity is the collection of all visual elements that represent your brand. It includes your logo, color palette, typography, imagery, 
            and design style. These elements work together to create a consistent and recognizable appearance across all touchpoints—be it your website, 
            marketing materials, or social media.
