          <h2>What is Technical Writing and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
          <p>
            Technical writing is a specialized form of writing that conveys complex information in an easily understandable manner. 
            It is often used in industries such as technology, engineering, healthcare, and software development to create content 
            like instruction manuals, guides, reports, and more. Good technical writing bridges the gap between technical experts 
            and end users, ensuring clarity and accuracy in communication.
